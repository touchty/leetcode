 * Given a range [m, n] where 0 <= m <= n <= 2147483647, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

/*
The idea is very simple:

last bit of (odd number & even number) is 0.
when m != n, There is at least an odd number and an even number, so the last bit position result is 0.
Move m and n rigth a position.
Keep doing step 1,2,3 until m equal to n, use a factor to record the iteration time.
