749. Contain Virus
A virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.
The world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated
with the virus. A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the
shared boundary.
Every night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall. Resources are
limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected
cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.
Can you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return
the number of walls used.

Example 1:
Input: grid =
[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 10
Explanation:
There are 2 contaminated regions.
On the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:

[[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],
 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]

On the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.
Example 2:
Input: grid =
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.
Notice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.
Example 3:
Input: grid =
[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 13
Explanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.

/*
The solution simply models the process.
Build walls = set those connected virus inactive, i.e. set as -1;
Affected area != walls; For example, one 0 surrounded by all 1s have area = 1, but walls = 4.
